        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <p>I am in my second year as a physics graduate student at the University of North Texas (UNT). I work with Dr. 
            <a href="http://physics.unt.edu/~yl0657/" onclick="toggleFunction()">Yuan Li</a>
            , typically doing machine learning or simulation-related projects. To see exactly what kind of research or get more details, see the 
            <a href="projects.html" onclick="toggleFunction()">Projects</a>
             section.</p>
        <p>I grew up in Frisco, Texas, about a 40-minute drive from UNT. After that, I attended the University of Colorado Boulder, where I got a B.A. in Astronomy. After graduating, I worked as a software engineer at GOGO CA, which does inflight wifi for private planes. There, I created and maintained tools for the analysis of data related to the usage of the service. I then returned home to Texas to attend graduate school at UNT.</p>
        <p>Outside of research, I like to: 3d print, as well as design 3d objects to print, melt and recycle metal to cast items, grow plants like strawberries, sometimes use one of my telescopes to observe or take pictures, and also just code for fun. </p>

        <h1>Black hole scaling relations in cosmological simulations using machine learning</h1>
        <p>Observations have established intriguing correlations between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. 
            However, state-of-the-art cosmological simulations have revealed discrepancies in the slope, amplitude, and scatter of
            the scaling relations when compared to both observational data and among different simulations. Understanding the underlying
            physical mechanisms responsible for these scaling relations remains a challenging task, although it has been demonstrated 
            that SMBH feedback plays a crucial role in shaping them within simulations. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive 
            analysis of SMBH-host scaling relations in three cosmological simulations, namely Illustris, TNG, and EAGLE. Leveraging
            the power of machine learning techniques, we quantify the tightness of each scaling relation across the different simulations.
            We find the M-sigma relation to be the tightest scaling relation across simulations except for TNG. EAGLE exhibits more
            scattered scaling relations overall. Additionally, we explore the dependence of scatter on SMBH mass and investigate SMBH-host
            "fundamental planes." Our analysis sheds light on the coevolution of SMBHs and galaxies in cosmological simulations with
            different SMBH feeding and feedback implementations. Our work also paves way for future studies to connect observations
            and simulations, and provide constraints for theoretical models.</p>

        <h1> Kelvin Hemholtz instability in jellyfish galaxies</h1>
        <p>We aim to create and analyze simulations that can represent the instability, and do analysis on this resulting turbulence to identify how factors like viscosity 
            effect different imporant factors like star formation.</p>
